# NOTICE

This respo is Public for demonstration purposes only. Much of the code here is very old, works but is old, and is not feasible. 

I did this project as a skill show-off while learning VB.NET and general programming from 2015 until an attempted [remake](https://github.com/jdc20181/Krypto-Browser) in 2019. The code here demonstrates my knowledge of concept - and how much I have grown since.

The new policy will reflect on effeciency in the open source community, providing a constructive policy pointing out what happens when you don't update. Support for older versions are removed every so often (everything is said in the wiki) - making outdated versions discontinued. 

In short, you should keep your application up to date with the latest version to avoid missing bug fixes and resolving issues which you may post about well after they are resolved with the next release.
